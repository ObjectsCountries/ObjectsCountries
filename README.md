## Other Projects

i have a whole lot of abandoned stuff in private repos, like a very early prototype for a pygame platformer and a rust GUI for ricing the `$PS1` of a terminal

also a bunch of abandoned ktane modules and module ideas that i'm too lazy to get around to

maybe i'll come back to them some day but idk xX3c
